# US-Elections-2020
As part of the Computer Programming and Data Management exam, included in my MSc program in Data Analytics for Business and Society at Ca' Foscari University, my team and I developed a project analyzing how economic, social and demographic factors influenced voter behavior and electoral outcomes in the 2020 US presidential elections.

📊 The project is based on data analysis techniques, visualization and statistical interpretation, with a regression model to identify key predictors of Democratic vote share and swing state behavior.

💡 With Visual Studio Code we used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and regression techniques to draw insights from multiple large-scale datasets.
